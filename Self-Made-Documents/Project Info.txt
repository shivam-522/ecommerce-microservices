1.Here we have four services and I use Eureka Server for calling them to each other. For this purpose One extra service need to make i.e Eureka Server. So first we need to run this server before running our apis. It should be up than only we can test our apis.Here we have added Eureka Client Dependency in our services to register service on Eureka Server and added properties inside application.properties for registering the service with Eureka Server also use annotation in the main class for eureka client in our service .
