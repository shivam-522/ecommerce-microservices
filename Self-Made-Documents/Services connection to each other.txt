Service-to-Service Communication Flow (Typical E-Commerce)
Here's the most logical service call pattern:

1. ðŸ›’ Order Service
Calls Product Service â†’ to get product details.

Calls Inventory Service â†’ to check stock / reduce stock.

Calls Payment Service â†’ to initiate payment.

2. ðŸ“¦ Inventory Service
No outgoing calls (only receives calls from Order Service).

3. ðŸ’³ Payment Service
May call Order Service â†’ to update order status (optional, or done via Kafka if async).
