E-Commerce Microservices Architecture Overview 🚀
We're building an E-Commerce Microservices System using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Eureka, Feign Client, MySQL, and optional Kafka. Below is a high-level breakdown of the architecture and how different components interact.

🔹 1. Microservices Overview
We will have four main microservices:

1️⃣ Product Service
Manages product information (CRUD operations).

Stores product details in the MySQL database.

Exposes REST APIs for other services to fetch product details.

No direct interaction with customers.

2️⃣ Order Service
Handles order creation, updates, and tracking.

Interacts with Product Service (to check product availability).

Communicates with Payment Service (to process payments).

Stores order details in the MySQL database.

3️⃣ Payment Service
Handles payments for orders.

Supports different payment methods (credit card, UPI, etc.).

Updates the Order Service after successful payment.

Stores payment transactions in the MySQL database.

4️⃣ Inventory Service
Tracks product stock levels.

Updates stock when an order is placed.

Communicates with Product Service to keep inventory data in sync.

Stores inventory details in the MySQL database.

🔹 2. Supporting Components
Apart from the four main microservices, we’ll also have supporting components:

5️⃣ API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

Routes requests to the correct microservice.

Helps in load balancing and security (authentication & authorization later).

6️⃣ Eureka Service Discovery
Registers all microservices.

Enables dynamic service discovery (services can find each other).

Makes the system more resilient to failures.

7️⃣ Feign Client (Service-to-Service Communication)
Enables HTTP-based communication between microservices.

Order Service → Product Service

Order Service → Payment Service

Payment Service → Order Service

8️⃣ Kafka (Optional - for Event-Driven Communication)
Used for asynchronous communication (e.g., sending notifications after order completion).

Example: Order Service publishes an event → Inventory Service listens and updates stock.

🔹 3. Architecture Flow
🔹 User places an order via API Gateway.
🔹 Order Service validates the request and checks inventory.
🔹 Product Service confirms the product details.
🔹 Inventory Service checks stock availability.
🔹 Payment Service processes the payment.
🔹 After successful payment:

Order status is updated.

Inventory is updated.

A Kafka event is published (if needed for notifications).

🔹 4. Tech Stack
Component	Technology Used
Framework	Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
Service Discovery	Eureka
API Gateway	Spring Cloud Gateway
Database	MySQL, JPA (Hibernate)
Inter-Service Communication	Feign Client, REST APIs
Message Queue (Optional)	Apache Kafka
Security (Later Phase)	Spring Security, JWT
🔹 5. Development Plan
We will build the project step by step:

🟢 Step 1: Project Setup
✅ Create 4 microservices (Product, Order, Payment, Inventory).
✅ Set up dependencies for each service in Spring Initializr.

🟢 Step 2: Develop Individual Microservices
✅ Implement Product Service (CRUD operations).
✅ Implement Order Service (place orders, check product availability).
✅ Implement Payment Service (handle transactions).
✅ Implement Inventory Service (stock management).

🟢 Step 3: Add Service Communication
✅ Use Feign Client for service-to-service calls.
✅ Implement Eureka Service Discovery to enable dynamic service registration.

🟢 Step 4: Implement API Gateway
✅ Set up Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests.
✅ Configure API routing for each microservice.

🟢 Step 5: Implement Database & Messaging
✅ Integrate MySQL databases for each service.
✅ Add Kafka (optional) for event-driven communication.

🟢 Step 6: Implement Security (Later Phase)
✅ Add JWT-based authentication & authorization using Spring Security.
